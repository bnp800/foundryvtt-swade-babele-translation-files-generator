_(English version)_

This module allows you to generate the JSON translation file of a compendium in order to facilitate the implementation
of translations for systems and/or modules.

It is possible to process any type of compendium and personalize the exported file using the mapping definition for
Babele (for `Actor`, `Item`, `Scene`, `JournalEntry` and `Adventure` compendiums).

## Installation

The system can be installed directly from Foundry by searching for its name: `SWADE - Translation files generator for Babele`.
You'll then have the latest version and benefit from automatic updates.

Alternatively, you can add it using its manifest link:
`https://github.com/bnp800/foundryvtt-swade-babele-translation-files-generator/releases/latest/download/module.json`

## Usage

Open the compendium exporter in the Compendium Packs tab. An application will then appear, allowing you to export
the translation file of a compendium selected from the list, or the translation files for bulk export.

If you already have a translation file, you can select it to obtain a new, up-to-date one which will contain the
translations you have already made as well as any new ones not present in your file.
